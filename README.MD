# BitsEscrow Mobile App

### [A forked BitsEcrow - Learning Gits cannot be easier]

### About
BitsEscrow is a simple Bitcoin escrow system. We always need to do business with people we dont trust on the internet all over the world. BitsEscrow stands as a third party that fulfils the initial stated escrow policy.

#### How it works
* Create an account with your email
* Fund your BitsEscrow wallet - (Copy wallet address from under Wallet tab)
* Fund escrow by entering the email address of the second person (The person must be a registered member)
* Come back to release the Bitcoin into his wallet once the deal is done, OR report a problem if the second person tried to play dirty.
* If any problem is reported by either of the two parties, BitsEscrow comes in and investigate who the real culprit is by asking them to provide credentials that'll prove their arguments.

## Features
* Prompt Email and in-app notifications
* Built on-top Blockcypher API (api.blockcypher.com)
* Backend completely written in Golang
* Real-time communication using Websocket
